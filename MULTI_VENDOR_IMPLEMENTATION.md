# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of multi-vendor functionality with seller-specific product management and a master/sub-order system for the e-commerce platform.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Seller-Specific Product Management
- **Problem Solved**: Products were appearing universally across all sellers
- **Solution**: Each product is strictly linked to its seller via `seller_id` foreign key
- **Implementation**:
  - Products are filtered by seller ID in all seller-side operations
  - Sellers can only view, edit, and delete their own products
  - Admin retains full visibility of all products

### 2. Multi-Vendor Order System
- **Master Order**: Tracks the complete customer order with total payment
- **Sub-Orders**: Separate orders created for each seller involved in the transaction
- **Benefits**:
  - Each seller only sees their relevant sub-orders
  - Commission is automatically calculated per seller
  - Admin has complete visibility of all orders and commission breakdown

## Backend Changes
